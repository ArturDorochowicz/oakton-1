<!--title:Extended ASP.Net Core Command Line Options-->

The *Oakton.AspNetCore* library can be used to extend the command line options of the typical ASP.Net Core application for:

* <[linkto:documentation/aspnetcore/run;title=An improved, default run command]>
* <[linkto:documentation/aspnetcore/environment;title=A new command for environment check support]>
* <[linkto:documentation/aspnetcore/extensions;title=Ability to add your own commands running in the context of your application]>

To enable the extended command line options in your ASP.Net Core application, first install the `Oakton.AspNetCore` nuget to your project. Then modify the `Program.Main()` method generated by the baseline *mvc* or other ASP.Net Core services to this:

<[sample:using-run-oakton-commands]>

There are just a couple things to note:

1. The return value of the `Program.Main()` method now needs to be `Task<int>` rather than `void`. This is done so that Oakton
   can return either successful or failure exit codes for usage in diagnostic commands you may want to stop automated builds upon
   failures.
1. You will use the `RunOaktonCommands()` method to accept the command line arguments and invoke your system rather than manually
   building and/or starting the `IWebHost` yourself
