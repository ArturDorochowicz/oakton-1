<!--title:Integration with HostBuilder-->

<[info]>
The functionality to integrate Oakton into .Net Core projects in *Oakton.AspNetCore* was combined
into the main Oakton library for V3.0.
<[/info]>

Oakton works well with the [generic HostBuilder](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/aspnet/core/fundamentals/host/generic-host?view=aspnetcore-5.0) in .Net Core and .Net 5 to extend the command line support
of your applications.

* <[linkto:documentation/hostbuilder/run;title=An improved, default run command]>
* <[linkto:documentation/hostbuilder/environment;title=A new command for environment check support]>
* <[linkto:documentation/hostbuilder/extensions;title=Ability to add your own commands running in the context of your application]>
* <[linkto:documentation/hostbuilder/describe;title=Extensible diagnostic data about your application]>

To enable the extended command line options in your .Net application bootstrapped by `IHostBuilder`, first install the `Oakton` nuget to your project. Then modify the `Program.Main()` method generated by the typical .Net project templates:

<[sample:using-run-oakton-commands-3]>

or with `IWebHostBuilder`:

<[sample:using-run-oakton-commands]>

There are just a couple things to note:

1. The return value of the `Program.Main()` method now needs to be `Task<int>` rather than `void`. This is done so that Oakton
   can return either successful or failure exit codes for usage in diagnostic commands you may want to stop automated builds upon
   failures.
1. You will use the `RunOaktonCommands()` method to accept the command line arguments and invoke your system rather than manually
   building and/or starting the `IWebHost` yourself
